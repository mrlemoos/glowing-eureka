# Glowing Eureka

The project -- alias **Glowing Eureka** -- is a Next.js application that uses the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API to generate text based on a prompt. This is a project which may be seen as a cheaper alternative to the [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) application.

## Advantages

- The application is cheaper than the ChatGPT application ($5/month vs $20/month) with all text generation models available and easy to use. You can use **GPT4**, **GPT3**, **Ada**, **Da Vinci**, and more!

## Prompts

- `Please list some blog post topics about Next.js 14 that could create great engagement.`
- `Please write a LinkedIn post based on the "Strategies for Optimizing Performance with Next.js". Also, if possible, include code snippets in markdown format.`
